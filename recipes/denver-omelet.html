    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>The Denver omelet is a change of pace from a French omelet and is known for its firmer texture and caramelized
        flavor. It's one of the first foods I learned to cook professionally as a line cook in high school. Make it a
        complete lunch or dinner with arugula salad and toasted bread.
